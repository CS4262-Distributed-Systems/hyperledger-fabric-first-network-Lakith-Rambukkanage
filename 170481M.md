# blockchains

1. Proof of work and proof of stake like mechanisms are used to make it expensive for attackers to gain control of the network. Proof of work is more robust to 51% attack (enough to mutate the chain) while proof of stake is efficient. 

2. Immutability, Anonymity(most cryptocurrencies), solution to double spending and decentralized nature are some of the key advantages of blockchains. The applications are not limited to cryptocurrencies and smart contract. Ex - NFTs (non-fungible tokens)
